# About
I recieved my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in computer engineering from Sharif University of Technology.
I'm interested in machine learning, computer vision, and image processing. 
I'm currently a PhD student at University of Alberta.
I'm supervised by
professor [Nilanjan Ray](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~nray1/index.html) from Computing Science department
and professor Gilbert Bigras from cross-cancer institue (CCI) and UofA department of Pathology.

# Research
In the past, cancer diagnosis was based on viewing tissues/cells under microscope.
Recently, making primary diagnosis from scanned/digitized pathology images has been officially approved.
Apart from its clinical benefits, [digital pathology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_pathology)
provided machine learning researchers with abundant of data.

My research is about developing/adopting machine learning methods for digitized pathology images.
        

# Code
We've developed a tool we called [PyDmed](https://github.com/amirakbarnejad/PyDmed) 
to facilitate developing machine learning methods for whole-slide images and medical images in general.
If you work on ML + medical imaging, [PyDmed](https://github.com/amirakbarnejad/PyDmed)
is really a life changer (research changer :) ). 

      
You can check out [PyDmed](https://github.com/amirakbarnejad/PyDmed)'s repository on
